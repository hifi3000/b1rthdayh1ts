Get all the number one songs on each of your birthdays

This was meant as a project/challenge/exercise.

By typing in your birthday, you will get all the number one songs of each year, that were the current number one on that date.

Workflow:

1.) Collect all number one songs from germany.

2.) First I designed and created a database for all the information (Datasource: Wikipedia).

3.) PHP to get the Information from the Database.

4.) Make it look nice with CSSS.

I'm sure, that this code can be improved.
