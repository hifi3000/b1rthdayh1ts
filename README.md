# B1RTHDAY H1TS
Get all the number one songs on each of your birthdays

This was meant as a project/challenge/exercise.

By typing in your birthday, you will get all the number one songs of each year, that were the current number one on that date.

Workflow:

1.) Database (design and create) for all the information (Datasource: Wikipedia).

2.) Collect all number one songs from germany. Fill the database.

3.) PHP to get the Information from the Database.

4.) Make it look nice with CSSS.

I'm sure, that this code can be improved.
